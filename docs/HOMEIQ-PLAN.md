# HomeIQ — the housing vertical on the AutoVerse engine

**One platform, two apps: DealerHunt Pro (cars) + HomeIQ (houses).** Same Supabase, same brain, free
stack (OpenStreetMap, no paid data APIs). HomeIQ reuses the chameleon scraper, geocoding, OSRM routing,
lead-scoring framework, and the local gate. Only the _entity_ and the _sources_ are housing-specific.

This doc is the grounded plan — corrected from the earlier claude.ai draft, which spec'd ~6 PAID data
APIs (Attom, CoreLogic, PropStream, BatchLeads, RentCast, RESO/MLS). We don't need any of them.

## What's already reused (the engine is domain-agnostic)

## Increment 1 — SHIPPED ✅ (proof the engine harvests houses)

- `lib/housing/types.ts` — the `Property` entity (address/beds/baths/sqft/lot/price/type).
- `lib/housing/sources/govdeals-property.ts` — reuses `fetchMaestroAssets` (the SAME GovDeals fetch the
  car scraper uses). **Verified live: 261 real US properties** — single-family fixers ($19,900 Canton IL),
  residential land, multi-family. Exactly the flip leads HomeIQ wants ("Deeply Discounted", "Rehab").
- `lib/housing/extract-property.ts` — `genericExtractProperties(html)`: schema.org + `__NEXT_DATA__`, so
  any housing portal that ships either pattern needs zero bespoke code. Tested.
- 16 unit tests; local gate green.

## Free source roadmap (replacing the paid plan, no MLS license needed)

| Lead type                  | Free source                              | Engine path                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gov / foreclosure disposal | GovDeals + AllSurplus real estate        | ✅ shipped (maestro)                                                                        |
| HUD homes                  | hudhomestore.gov                         | chameleon (likely `__NEXT_DATA__`/JSON)                                                     |
| Federal real estate        | GSA `realestatesales.gov`                | chameleon (SPA — Antigravity capture, like GSA autos)                                       |
| FSBO / by-owner            | Craigslist `/search/rea`, fsbo.com       | reuse CL engine (search went JS — needs the CL JSON path)                                   |
| Pre-foreclosure            | county NOD / Lis Pendens (public record) | per-county scrapers via chameleon                                                           |
| Tax-delinquent / vacant    | county assessor + USPS vacancy           | per-county, public record                                                                   |
| Portal listings            | Zillow/Redfin/Realtor public pages       | chameleon (walled — fleet/clean IP; `genericExtractProperties` reads their `__NEXT_DATA__`) |

**The one honest paid exception:** skip-trace (owner phone/email for off-market). Free path = public-record
scraping (county + voter + business filings), state-by-state and slower. Flag for a decision later — do NOT
bake in a paid broker by default.

## Schema (when ready — needs a migration + user auth)

Vertical-agnostic core + vertical-specific details (the right call from the architecture discussion):

```
leads        id, user_id, vertical ('car'|'house'), lead_score, status, source, created_at
property_details   lead_id, address, city, state, zip, lat, lng, price, beds, baths, sqft,
                   lot_acres, year_built, property_type, signals jsonb
vehicle_details    (= today's deals table)
pipeline / alerts / contacts / geocode_cache   ← shared, already exist
```

Until the migration is authed, HomeIQ harvests to `Property[]` in memory (proven) — wiring to a
`property_details` table is the next DB step.

## Lead-intelligence signals (housing) — the scoring layer

price-cut velocity · days-on-market · vacancy · pre-foreclosure/NOD · absentee owner · probate/estate ·
price-vs-AVM gap · back-on-market. Same weighted-score shape as the car deal-analyzer; ARV + the 70% rule
(`MAO = ARV×0.70 − repairs`) is the housing analogue of the car max-bid.

## Phases

1. **FIND** (engine reuse — in progress): more free sources → harvest → geocode → map. ← we are here
2. **SCORE**: housing lead-score engine, hot-leads feed, signal badges, alerts.
3. **ACT**: skip-trace (public-record first), one-tap contact, shared pipeline CRM, ARV/MAO deal analyzer.
4. **MEAN**: location-intelligence overlays (flood/school-trend/appreciation) — free public datasets.
5. **GROW**: financing, market dashboard, community.
